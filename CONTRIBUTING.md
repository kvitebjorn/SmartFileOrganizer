## **1. Writing the Best Commits**

### **a. Commit Messages: Best Practices**
A good commit message communicates **what** was changed and **why** it was changed. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Use a Clear and Concise Subject Line**:
   - Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
   - Use the imperative mood (e.g., "Add", "Fix", "Update", "Remove").
   - Example: `Fix file search bug in dark mode`

2. **Add a Detailed Body (if needed)**:
   - Use the body to explain **why** the change was made and **how** it works.
   - Wrap the body at 72 characters per line.
   - Example:
     ```
     Fix file search bug in dark mode

     The file search functionality was not working in dark mode due to a CSS
     issue. This commit fixes the contrast issue by updating the text color
     in the search bar.
     ```

3. **Reference Issues or Tickets**:
   - If the commit is related to an issue or ticket, reference it in the commit message.
   - Example: `Fix file search bug in dark mode (closes #123)`

4. **Follow a Consistent Format**:
   - Use a consistent format across the project. For example:
     ```
     <type>: <subject>
     <BLANK LINE>
     <body>
     ```
     - `<type>`: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`, etc.
     - Example:
       ```
       feat: add file tagging functionality

       This commit adds the ability to tag files with custom labels. Users can
       now organize files more efficiently using tags.
       ```

---

### **b. Atomic Commits**
- **One Change per Commit**: Each commit should represent a single logical change. Avoid bundling multiple unrelated changes into one commit.
- **Small and Focused**: Keep commits small and focused. This makes it easier to review and revert changes if needed.

---

### **c. Use Branches for Features**
- Create a new branch for each feature or bug fix. For example:
  ```
  git checkout -b feature/file-tagging
  ```
- Commit your changes to this branch before creating a PR.

---

## **2. Writing the Best Pull Requests (PRs)**

### **a. PR Title**
- Use a clear and descriptive title that summarizes the changes.
- Example: `Add file tagging functionality`

---

### **b. PR Description**
The PR description is your opportunity to explain the changes in detail. Follow this structure:

1. **What**:
   - Briefly describe what the PR does.
   - Example: "This PR adds the ability to tag files with custom labels."

2. **Why**:
   - Explain why the change is necessary.
   - Example: "This feature will help users organize files more efficiently."

3. **How**:
   - Provide details about how the change was implemented.
   - Example: "The tagging functionality is implemented using a new `Tag` model and a UI component for adding/removing tags."


4. **Testing**:
   - Mention how the changes were tested.
   - Example: "I tested this feature by tagging files and verifying that the tags persist across sessions."

5. **Related Issues**:
   - Reference any related issues or tickets.
   - Example: "Closes #123"

---

### **c. Keep PRs Small and Focused**
- **Single Responsibility**: Each PR should address a single feature, bug fix, or improvement.
- **Avoid Large PRs**: Large PRs are harder to review. Break them into smaller, manageable PRs if possible.

---

### **d. Review Your Own PR**
- Before requesting a review, go through your own PR:
  - Check for typos, formatting issues, or unnecessary changes.
  - Ensure the code follows the project's style guide.
  - Verify that all tests pass.

---

### **e. Request Reviews**
- Assign reviewers who are familiar with the part of the codebase you‚Äôve changed.
- Provide context to reviewers by mentioning specific files or changes that need attention.

---

### **f. Respond to Feedback**
- Be open to feedback and address comments promptly.
- If you make changes based on feedback, push new commits to the same branch. The PR will update automatically.

---


### **d. Use Templates**
- Create PR and commit message templates to standardize communication.
- Example PR template:
  ```markdown
  ### What
  [Brief description of the changes]

  ### Why
  [Explain why the changes are necessary]

  ### How
  [Describe how the changes were implemented]

  ### Screenshots
  [Add screenshots or GIFs if applicable]

  ### Testing
  [Describe how the changes were tested]

  ### Related Issues
  [Reference related issues or tickets]
  ```

---

## **4. Example Workflow**

### **a. Writing a Commit**
1. Make changes to your code.
2. Stage the changes:
   ```
   git add .
   ```
3. Write a commit message:
   ```
   git commit -m "feat: add file tagging functionality

   This commit adds the ability to tag files with custom labels. Users can
   now organize files more efficiently using tags."
   ```

### **b. Creating a PR**
1. Push your branch to GitHub:
   ```
   git push origin feature/file-tagging
   ```
2. Open a PR on GitHub with a clear title and description.
3. Request reviews from team members.
4. Address feedback and push new commits if needed.
5. Once approved, merge the PR into the main branch.

By following these guidelines, you‚Äôll write clear, meaningful commits and PRs that make collaboration easier and improve the overall quality of your project.
